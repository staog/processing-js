# processing-js
ProcessingJS allows web browsers to display animations, visual applications, games and other graphical rich content without the need for a Java applet or Flash plugin. 

It is the sister project of the popular Processing visual programming language, designed for the web. Processing.js makes your data visualizations, digital art, interactive animations, educational graphs, video games, etc. work using web standards and without any plug-ins. You write code using the Processing language, include it in your web page, and Processing.js does the rest. It's not magic, but almost.
